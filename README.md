# fabric-painter
A fabric mod for painting with the ArtMap plugin

## SETUP
DISCLAIMER: This is only for eclipse and probably wont work

- in the directory with the gradle stuff type "gradlew genSources"
- do "gradlew eclipse"
- do "gradlew genEclipseRuns"

Everything after this point is even more of a guess than before
- open eclipse, then create a gradle project
- select directory above the directory with the gradle stuff as the work directory
- hope it works, as it should detect the run configs and let you run stuff
- if this doesn't work I have no idea how to fix it
